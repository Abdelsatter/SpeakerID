For Extraction Process And DB Insertion:
- Time Before Optimization (Using Normal Nested ForEach Loops): ~10 minutes
- Time After Using Parallelism (Using Default Parameters of Parallel.ForEach): ~7.62 minutes
- Time After Flattening and using ForEach Loop: ~5.48 minutes

Splitting Extraction Process and Insertion Process 
as we have to make multiple connections and 
this takes time also not logically correct using Concurrency

For Extraction Process ONLY
- Using Default Parameters: ~5.62 minutes
- MaxDegreeOfParallelism = 6: ~5.85 minutes
- MaxDegreeOfParallelism = 4: ~5.50 minutes
- MaxDegreeOfParallelism = Environment.ProcessorCount: ~5.81 minutes
- Partitioning = ~5.55 minutes
- Partitioning with Array not LinkedList: ~6.32 minutes

Current Time = ~5.47 minutes (Needs Optimization = 1.50 min)

W = MAX(W, 2*|rows â€“ cols|)
int jStart = Math.Max(1, i - W);
int jEnd = Math.Min(M, i + W);
