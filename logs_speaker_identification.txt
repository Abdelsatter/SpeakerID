TRAINING DATA
CASE 1
By Splitting Extraction Process and Insertion Process 
as we have to make multiple connections and 
this takes time

For Extraction Process ONLY
- Time Before Optimization (Using Normal Nested ForEach Loops): ~10 minutes
- Time After Using Parallelism (Using Default Parameters of Parallel.ForEach): ~7.62 minutes
- Time After Flattening and using ForEach Loop: ~5.48 minutes
- Using Default Parameters: ~5.62 minutes
- MaxDegreeOfParallelism = 6: ~5.85 minutes
- MaxDegreeOfParallelism = 4: ~5.50 minutes
- MaxDegreeOfParallelism = Environment.ProcessorCount: ~5.81 minutes
- Partitioning = ~5.55 minutes
- Partitioning with Array not LinkedList: ~6.32 minutes

CASE 1
Current Time = ~5.45 minutes (Needs Optimization = 1.50 min)

CASE 2
Concurrency: ~5.72 minutes

CASE 3
Concurrency: ~4.40 minutes


TESTING DATA 
CASE 1
For Extraction Process and Matching with Train Data
- Time before optimization got accuracy: 47.27% -> (> 4.15) minutes without Pruning
- Time before using normal indexed-arrays as optimization got accuracy: 47.27% -> (~2.52) minutes with Pruning

Concurrency
- Got accuracy: 52.73% -> (~1.36) minutes without Pruning
- Got accuracy: 52.73% -> (~1.00) minutes with Pruning (23)

CASE 2
Concurrency
- Got accuracy: 52.73% -> (~2.01) minutes with Pruning (55)

CASE 3
- Got accuracy: 50.00% -> (~6.85) minutes with pruning (11)
